#summary Outcomes from ODaF 2010 SDMX-RDF work

= SDMX-RDF process at ODaF 2010 =

This page summarizes outcome from the SDMX-RDF working discussions at
the Open Data Foundation (ODaF) 2010 meeting at Tilburg.

== Summary points ==

The meeting reinforced the value of establishing
standards and practice now for how to publish statistical and related data
in linked data form to avoid the chaos of multiple incompatible approaches evolving.

There are further potential use cases for linked data in statistics beyond the core
aggregated data targeted by SDMX-RDF. In particular, representing micro-data (survey information as supported by [http://www.ddialliance.org/ DDI]) or rather metadata for it would complement SDMX-RDF and, for example, support deep provenance track back.

We identified a need for a common core vocabulary for linked data publication of 
data cubes for web-dissemination. The cube models for SDMX and DDI are already compatible, by design so a single vocabulary for cubes could be extended by further 
modular vocabularies for SDMX specific, microdata/DDI specific and other usages (e.g. 
reference metadata, classifications). We partitioned the existing SDMX-RDF proposals 
identifying this reusable data cube core and clarified a number of the associated 
open issues.

Several of the current open issues are either not relevant to the data cube core, were resolved or are simply a matter of doing the work. The primary open issues requiring further investigation before final resolution are:

   * flattening - whether dimension and attribute values should (always) be flattened
down to the observation level
   * standardized URI schemes for identifying elements below DataSets
   * validation
