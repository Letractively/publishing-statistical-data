#summary Documentation on the SDMX-RDF vocabulary for encoding linked statistical data.

= Introduction =

These pages describe an approach to encoding statistical data in a linked open data way. The core vocabulary for the encoding is based on the statistical encoding standard [http://www.sdmx.org SDMX], while the basic approach is derived from [http://sw.joanneum.at/scovo/schema.html Scovo].

Documents on this site explain the current vocabulary, core patterns of use, and illustrate some worked examples. The site also includes a catalogue of problem-oriented patterns that have been found to be useful in certain situations.

We are still actively developing the SDMX-RDF vocabulary and usage patterns. Current open design issues are documented in the issues list for this project; longer more complex design issues are broken out into separate wiki pages.

Readers are encouraged to report issues and bugs via the [http://code.google.com/p/publishing-statistical-data/issues/list issues list], or to ask general support questions on the [http://groups.google.com/group/publishing-statistical-data related Google group].
